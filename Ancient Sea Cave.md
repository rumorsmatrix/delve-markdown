## Ancient Sea Cave
**This place holds the secrets of a bygone age.** An ancient site contains the mysteries, legacies, and dangers of another age.

Walking the paths of this place is like stepping through time. Ruins and relics provide glimpses of long-forgotten people and events. The knowledge and power hidden here are a tempting lure, but those treasures may come with a dire cost. Some secrets are best left buried.

**Stone passages carved by ocean waves.** Carved by ocean waves and unyielding currents, the sea caves pockmarking the coasts plunge deep into the landâ€™s dark heart. Deadly creatures or determined foes often lair within, but it is the water that is your ever-present enemy. The chill and damp seep into your bones. The tides and upland flooding can bring a torrent of water with little warning. You plunge desperately through submerged passages, praying that an opening will provide a pocket of air.

This is a realm of water and stone, cold and darkness. You are not welcome here.
