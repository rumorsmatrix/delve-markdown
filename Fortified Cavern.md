## Fortified Cavern
**Foes defend this place against intruders.** A fortified site is held and defended by an enemy force. It might be an enemy camp, an outpost, a fortress, or a closely-guarded territory.

Infiltrating this place requires caution and cunning. You may be forced to avoid inhabitants, sentries, and patrols. Revealing yourself or causing a disturbance will catch the attention of the denizens, perhaps forcing you to fight your way to your objective.

**A place of stone and darkness.** Another world lies beneath our feet. Caverns vein the Ironlands with meandering tunnels, plunging pits, soaring chambers, and absolute darkness. Claustrophobic crawlspaces and crevices may lead to miles-long cave complexes. Underground waterways carve a relentless path through stone.

When you enter these sites, you are a trespasser in a hostile domain. What unseen things dwell here, watching and waiting, amidst the depths?
