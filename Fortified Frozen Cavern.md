## Fortified Frozen Cavern
**Foes defend this place against intruders.** A fortified site is held and defended by an enemy force. It might be an enemy camp, an outpost, a fortress, or a closely-guarded territory.

Infiltrating this place requires caution and cunning. You may be forced to avoid inhabitants, sentries, and patrols. Revealing yourself or causing a disturbance will catch the attention of the denizens, perhaps forcing you to fight your way to your objective.

**A place of deep caves and enduring cold.** These maze-like tunnels are found in the most inhospitable northern reaches of the Ironlands—carved through glacier, mountain, and hill—or in places of supernatural cold. Their icy depths are a perilous environment of fracturing terrain, shadowy reflections, hollow echoes, and lurking predators.

Entering a frozen cavern is like delving into another world. There is a stark beauty in the icebound passages and glistening chambers. Amazing discoveries, locked in the ice, lie unseen for millennia. But do not be distracted by those enticements. The hazards of this site have no sympathy for the unwary and ill-prepared.
