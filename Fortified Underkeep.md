## Fortified Underkeep
**Foes defend this place against intruders.** A fortified site is held and defended by an enemy force. It might be an enemy camp, an outpost, a fortress, or a closely-guarded territory.

Infiltrating this place requires caution and cunning. You may be forced to avoid inhabitants, sentries, and patrols. Revealing yourself or causing a disturbance will catch the attention of the denizens, perhaps forcing you to fight your way to your objective.

**An age-old subterranean dungeon.** These subterranean structures are a mystery. They are inexplicably ancient, older perhaps than even the Firstborn. Their passages and halls hide dangers within unfathomable darkness.

Most Ironlanders stay well clear of these places. But some stumble upon the entrance to an underkeep and delve inside, drawn by its secrets or the alluring promise of forgotten power. Others, desperate for protection from the perils of the surface world, foolishly try to use the depths of an underkeep as a sanctum for their kin or clan. They soon discover that the greatest threats lie beneath.
