## Infested Mine
**Foul creatures dwell here.** Foul creatures swarm these sites, overwhelming trespassers with sheer numbers and unchecked ferocity. The denizens do little beyond multiplying, feeding, and expanding, ravenous for fresh kills to feed the swarm.

Navigation through this place, across paths undermined by the hordes, may be perilous. The sights and smells may test your fortitude. But it is the creatures which pose the greatest threat, as they ambush and cut off your escape with unforeseen cunning.

**Tunnels dug greedily and deep.** Within the earth, riches await the bold. Some mines are shallow pits worked by pick and shovel. Others are offshoots of existing caverns which pierce deep into hills and mountains. A few are the remains of vast underground complexes built by forgotten cultures.

The iron and other metals claimed from these sites feed our furnaces. From those fires, we craft tools, armor, weapons, and other precious goods. Our hunger for these resources is never satiated, and we often dig into places best left undisturbed.
