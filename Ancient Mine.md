## Ancient Mine
**This place holds the secrets of a bygone age.** An ancient site contains the mysteries, legacies, and dangers of another age.

Walking the paths of this place is like stepping through time. Ruins and relics provide glimpses of long-forgotten people and events. The knowledge and power hidden here are a tempting lure, but those treasures may come with a dire cost. Some secrets are best left buried.

**Tunnels dug greedily and deep.** Within the earth, riches await the bold. Some mines are shallow pits worked by pick and shovel. Others are offshoots of existing caverns which pierce deep into hills and mountains. A few are the remains of vast underground complexes built by forgotten cultures.

The iron and other metals claimed from these sites feed our furnaces. From those fires, we craft tools, armor, weapons, and other precious goods. Our hunger for these resources is never satiated, and we often dig into places best left undisturbed.
