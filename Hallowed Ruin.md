## Hallowed Ruin
**The faithful worship here.** A hallowed site is a place of great reverence, suffused with the power of old gods or the fervency of belief. It might be a location of religious significance, the resting place of legendary relics or figures, or the haven of a religious leader.

Hallowed places may be warded by ancient rituals, or imbued with divine energy. But it is the faithful and the zealous who will sacrifice everything to defend this place.

**The crumbling legacy of a dead civilization.** These decaying edifices, skeletal and shadowed, mark the remains of once-great communities and civilizations. Some of these sites have been newly adapted by Ironlanders as shelter, temple, or citadel. Others are home only to dangerous creatures and dark forces.

Newly discovered ruins tempt bold explorers with the promise of powerful legacies and forgotten secrets. But most see these places as a portent of our inescapable, grim fate in these lands. Someday, another people may delve into the ruins of what we leave behind.
