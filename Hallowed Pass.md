## Hallowed Pass
**The faithful worship here.** A hallowed site is a place of great reverence, suffused with the power of old gods or the fervency of belief. It might be a location of religious significance, the resting place of legendary relics or figures, or the haven of a religious leader.

Hallowed places may be warded by ancient rituals, or imbued with divine energy. But it is the faithful and the zealous who will sacrifice everything to defend this place.

**Treacherous paths over high mountains.** Winding through highlands and mountain ranges, these sites offer a tempting route over otherwise impassable terrain. But treacherous landscapes, foul weather, and a host of mountain predators offer their own dangers. Raiders and others take advantage of these natural chokepoints to ambush the unwary.

Lonely cairns mark the resting places of those who walked these routes undefended or unprepared. Pray that your path here does not end under a pile of mountain stones.
