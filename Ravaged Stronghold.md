## Ravaged Stronghold
**Time, disaster, or strife have taken their toll.** Time, weather, war, or calamity have laid waste to a ravaged site. The terrain is precarious. Hazards lurk around every corner. You may face glimpses of a former greatness, but this place is a ruined shadow of what it once was.

Traversing a ravaged site requires care, cunning, and quick wits to react to sudden perils. The environment here is your greatest enemy. It is a force, as willful as any intelligent adversary, which will see your quest undone.

**A fortress secured against trespassers.** These sites weather storms and sieges alike. Their walls stand firm against the forces of this dark land. They are fortified against attack and rife with guards, traps, and other defenses. For those who dwell within, strongholds provide the comfort of wood and stone, axe and bow. For those who seek to breach the walls, they can be as unyielding and unforgiving as the most stalwart ironbound shield.
