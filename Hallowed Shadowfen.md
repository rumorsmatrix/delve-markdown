## Hallowed Shadowfen
**The faithful worship here.** A hallowed site is a place of great reverence, suffused with the power of old gods or the fervency of belief. It might be a location of religious significance, the resting place of legendary relics or figures, or the haven of a religious leader.

Hallowed places may be warded by ancient rituals, or imbued with divine energy. But it is the faithful and the zealous who will sacrifice everything to defend this place.

**A primeval marsh, cloaked in mist.** These foul sites are cloaked in mist, clogged with muddy peat, and drenched in fetid water. Thickets of gray, skeletal trees conceal stalking creatures. Strange shapes move in the fog and beneath dark, placid water. Narrow trails tease with the promise of passage, but instead lead to hidden quagmires.

Be wary. When you enter a shadowfen, the specter of death is your constant companion.
