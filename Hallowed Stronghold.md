## Hallowed Stronghold
**The faithful worship here.** A hallowed site is a place of great reverence, suffused with the power of old gods or the fervency of belief. It might be a location of religious significance, the resting place of legendary relics or figures, or the haven of a religious leader.

Hallowed places may be warded by ancient rituals, or imbued with divine energy. But it is the faithful and the zealous who will sacrifice everything to defend this place.

**A fortress secured against trespassers.** These sites weather storms and sieges alike. Their walls stand firm against the forces of this dark land. They are fortified against attack and rife with guards, traps, and other defenses. For those who dwell within, strongholds provide the comfort of wood and stone, axe and bow. For those who seek to breach the walls, they can be as unyielding and unforgiving as the most stalwart ironbound shield.
