## Haunted Tanglewood
**Restless spirits are bound to this place.** Within a haunted site, dread, sadness, and fear are palpable. Disturbing sounds and visions lure the unwary and terrorize the vulnerable. Gird your will when you enter this place, for you walk at the boundary of life and death.

Some lost souls, unaware they have passed, wander the site in search of answers. Others, stricken by eternal grief, seek to set right what caused their death or see their vows fulfilled. But all too often, the denizens of this place are undone by their deaths. They are rage and terror made incarnate, feeling nothing but hate for the living and a hunger for warmth which will never be sated.

**A perilous forest of eternal shadow.** A tanglewood is a thick wilderness, shrouded in mist. Overhanging, twisted boughs obscure the sky. The ground is snarled with exposed roots. The wind carries foreboding whispers, and branches rattle like old bones.

Many refuse to harvest wood from these places, believing the spirits who reside within will bring a curse upon them and their families. Others fear the creatures and beings which lurk within. For these reasons, even near settled areas, the tangles still stand.
