## Fortified Barrow
**Foes defend this place against intruders.** A fortified site is held and defended by an enemy force. It might be an enemy camp, an outpost, a fortress, or a closely-guarded territory.

Infiltrating this place requires caution and cunning. You may be forced to avoid inhabitants, sentries, and patrols. Revealing yourself or causing a disturbance will catch the attention of the denizens, perhaps forcing you to fight your way to your objective.

**The dead are enshrined here.** In this cruel land, there is no shortage of dead to be put to rest. Some barrows are simple crypts for a family or steading. Others are more elaborate or extensive, plunging well into the depths of the earth. A few inconspicuous mounds, their rock and earth worn by time, mark an entryway into impossibly labyrinthine tombs built by long-forgotten people.

Even the most ancient of these sites still echo with the memory and power of lives once lived, battles once fought, loves gained or lost, and vows unfulfilled.
