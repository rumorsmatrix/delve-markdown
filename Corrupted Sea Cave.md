## Corrupted Sea Cave
**This place is tainted by dark magic.** A corrupted site is befouled by dark forces. It might be the ancient magic of the Ironlands, or the residue of ancient evils, concentrated here like poisoned water soaked into a sponge. Perhaps a powerful mystic dwells in this place, one who walks a sinister path in search of power.

When you enter a corrupted site, you can feel the wrongness of it down to your bones. The air is tainted with foul smells, or tinged with strange energies. You hear unintelligible whispers. Shadows lurk at the edge of your vision. The creatures of this place are twisted by corruption, and the people are in thrall to a dark influence.

**Stone passages carved by ocean waves.** Carved by ocean waves and unyielding currents, the sea caves pockmarking the coasts plunge deep into the landâ€™s dark heart. Deadly creatures or determined foes often lair within, but it is the water that is your ever-present enemy. The chill and damp seep into your bones. The tides and upland flooding can bring a torrent of water with little warning. You plunge desperately through submerged passages, praying that an opening will provide a pocket of air.

This is a realm of water and stone, cold and darkness. You are not welcome here.
