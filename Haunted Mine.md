## Haunted Mine
**Restless spirits are bound to this place.** Within a haunted site, dread, sadness, and fear are palpable. Disturbing sounds and visions lure the unwary and terrorize the vulnerable. Gird your will when you enter this place, for you walk at the boundary of life and death.

Some lost souls, unaware they have passed, wander the site in search of answers. Others, stricken by eternal grief, seek to set right what caused their death or see their vows fulfilled. But all too often, the denizens of this place are undone by their deaths. They are rage and terror made incarnate, feeling nothing but hate for the living and a hunger for warmth which will never be sated.

**Tunnels dug greedily and deep.** Within the earth, riches await the bold. Some mines are shallow pits worked by pick and shovel. Others are offshoots of existing caverns which pierce deep into hills and mountains. A few are the remains of vast underground complexes built by forgotten cultures.

The iron and other metals claimed from these sites feed our furnaces. From those fires, we craft tools, armor, weapons, and other precious goods. Our hunger for these resources is never satiated, and we often dig into places best left undisturbed.
