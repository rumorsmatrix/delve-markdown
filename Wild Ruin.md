## Wild Ruin
**Nature prevails in this place.** Despite our attempts to extend our control into untracked reaches, the primal forces of nature still hold sway across the Ironlands. In those wild places, we must test our shields against tooth and claw, our wits against insidious creatures, and our resolve against dangerous terrain and harsh environments.

Be wary when you enter the wild places of this world. Beyond the comforting walls of your village, you are not the hunter. You are the prey.

**The crumbling legacy of a dead civilization.** These decaying edifices, skeletal and shadowed, mark the remains of once-great communities and civilizations. Some of these sites have been newly adapted by Ironlanders as shelter, temple, or citadel. Others are home only to dangerous creatures and dark forces.

Newly discovered ruins tempt bold explorers with the promise of powerful legacies and forgotten secrets. But most see these places as a portent of our inescapable, grim fate in these lands. Someday, another people may delve into the ruins of what we leave behind.
