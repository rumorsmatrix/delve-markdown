## Ravaged Mine
**Time, disaster, or strife have taken their toll.** Time, weather, war, or calamity have laid waste to a ravaged site. The terrain is precarious. Hazards lurk around every corner. You may face glimpses of a former greatness, but this place is a ruined shadow of what it once was.

Traversing a ravaged site requires care, cunning, and quick wits to react to sudden perils. The environment here is your greatest enemy. It is a force, as willful as any intelligent adversary, which will see your quest undone.

**Tunnels dug greedily and deep.** Within the earth, riches await the bold. Some mines are shallow pits worked by pick and shovel. Others are offshoots of existing caverns which pierce deep into hills and mountains. A few are the remains of vast underground complexes built by forgotten cultures.

The iron and other metals claimed from these sites feed our furnaces. From those fires, we craft tools, armor, weapons, and other precious goods. Our hunger for these resources is never satiated, and we often dig into places best left undisturbed.
