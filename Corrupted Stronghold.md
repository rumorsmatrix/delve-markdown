## Corrupted Stronghold
**This place is tainted by dark magic.** A corrupted site is befouled by dark forces. It might be the ancient magic of the Ironlands, or the residue of ancient evils, concentrated here like poisoned water soaked into a sponge. Perhaps a powerful mystic dwells in this place, one who walks a sinister path in search of power.

When you enter a corrupted site, you can feel the wrongness of it down to your bones. The air is tainted with foul smells, or tinged with strange energies. You hear unintelligible whispers. Shadows lurk at the edge of your vision. The creatures of this place are twisted by corruption, and the people are in thrall to a dark influence.

**A fortress secured against trespassers.** These sites weather storms and sieges alike. Their walls stand firm against the forces of this dark land. They are fortified against attack and rife with guards, traps, and other defenses. For those who dwell within, strongholds provide the comfort of wood and stone, axe and bow. For those who seek to breach the walls, they can be as unyielding and unforgiving as the most stalwart ironbound shield.
