## Corrupted Shadowfen
**This place is tainted by dark magic.** A corrupted site is befouled by dark forces. It might be the ancient magic of the Ironlands, or the residue of ancient evils, concentrated here like poisoned water soaked into a sponge. Perhaps a powerful mystic dwells in this place, one who walks a sinister path in search of power.

When you enter a corrupted site, you can feel the wrongness of it down to your bones. The air is tainted with foul smells, or tinged with strange energies. You hear unintelligible whispers. Shadows lurk at the edge of your vision. The creatures of this place are twisted by corruption, and the people are in thrall to a dark influence.

**A primeval marsh, cloaked in mist.** These foul sites are cloaked in mist, clogged with muddy peat, and drenched in fetid water. Thickets of gray, skeletal trees conceal stalking creatures. Strange shapes move in the fog and beneath dark, placid water. Narrow trails tease with the promise of passage, but instead lead to hidden quagmires.

Be wary. When you enter a shadowfen, the specter of death is your constant companion.
