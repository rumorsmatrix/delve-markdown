## Infested Pass
**Foul creatures dwell here.** Foul creatures swarm these sites, overwhelming trespassers with sheer numbers and unchecked ferocity. The denizens do little beyond multiplying, feeding, and expanding, ravenous for fresh kills to feed the swarm.

Navigation through this place, across paths undermined by the hordes, may be perilous. The sights and smells may test your fortitude. But it is the creatures which pose the greatest threat, as they ambush and cut off your escape with unforeseen cunning.

**Treacherous paths over high mountains.** Winding through highlands and mountain ranges, these sites offer a tempting route over otherwise impassable terrain. But treacherous landscapes, foul weather, and a host of mountain predators offer their own dangers. Raiders and others take advantage of these natural chokepoints to ambush the unwary.

Lonely cairns mark the resting places of those who walked these routes undefended or unprepared. Pray that your path here does not end under a pile of mountain stones.
