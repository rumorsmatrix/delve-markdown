## Ancient Cavern
**This place holds the secrets of a bygone age.** An ancient site contains the mysteries, legacies, and dangers of another age.

Walking the paths of this place is like stepping through time. Ruins and relics provide glimpses of long-forgotten people and events. The knowledge and power hidden here are a tempting lure, but those treasures may come with a dire cost. Some secrets are best left buried.

**A place of stone and darkness.** Another world lies beneath our feet. Caverns vein the Ironlands with meandering tunnels, plunging pits, soaring chambers, and absolute darkness. Claustrophobic crawlspaces and crevices may lead to miles-long cave complexes. Underground waterways carve a relentless path through stone.

When you enter these sites, you are a trespasser in a hostile domain. What unseen things dwell here, watching and waiting, amidst the depths?
