## Infested Sea Cave
**Foul creatures dwell here.** Foul creatures swarm these sites, overwhelming trespassers with sheer numbers and unchecked ferocity. The denizens do little beyond multiplying, feeding, and expanding, ravenous for fresh kills to feed the swarm.

Navigation through this place, across paths undermined by the hordes, may be perilous. The sights and smells may test your fortitude. But it is the creatures which pose the greatest threat, as they ambush and cut off your escape with unforeseen cunning.

**Stone passages carved by ocean waves.** Carved by ocean waves and unyielding currents, the sea caves pockmarking the coasts plunge deep into the land’s dark heart. Deadly creatures or determined foes often lair within, but it is the water that is your ever-present enemy. The chill and damp seep into your bones. The tides and upland flooding can bring a torrent of water with little warning. You plunge desperately through submerged passages, praying that an opening will provide a pocket of air.

This is a realm of water and stone, cold and darkness. You are not welcome here.
