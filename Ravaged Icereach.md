## Ravaged Icereach
**Time, disaster, or strife have taken their toll.** Time, weather, war, or calamity have laid waste to a ravaged site. The terrain is precarious. Hazards lurk around every corner. You may face glimpses of a former greatness, but this place is a ruined shadow of what it once was.

Traversing a ravaged site requires care, cunning, and quick wits to react to sudden perils. The environment here is your greatest enemy. It is a force, as willful as any intelligent adversary, which will see your quest undone.

**A frigid landscape formed of frozen seas.** An Icereach is an expanse of frozen sea, blue-white and sprawling in all directions. These sites are typically found in the northernmost waters. However, a few vast icereaches— kept perpetually frozen by forces we do not understand—clog the seas in southern regions.

Only the cruelest, most powerful creatures can survive here. The terrain is rugged and cut-through with unstable ice and frigid waterways. Food is scarce. Bitter winds blast the landscape. The remains of ships, locked within the ice, stand as monuments to those who braved these places and were forever lost.
