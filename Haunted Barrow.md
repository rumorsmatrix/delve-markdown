## Haunted Barrow
**Restless spirits are bound to this place.** Within a haunted site, dread, sadness, and fear are palpable. Disturbing sounds and visions lure the unwary and terrorize the vulnerable. Gird your will when you enter this place, for you walk at the boundary of life and death.

Some lost souls, unaware they have passed, wander the site in search of answers. Others, stricken by eternal grief, seek to set right what caused their death or see their vows fulfilled. But all too often, the denizens of this place are undone by their deaths. They are rage and terror made incarnate, feeling nothing but hate for the living and a hunger for warmth which will never be sated.

**The dead are enshrined here.** In this cruel land, there is no shortage of dead to be put to rest. Some barrows are simple crypts for a family or steading. Others are more elaborate or extensive, plunging well into the depths of the earth. A few inconspicuous mounds, their rock and earth worn by time, mark an entryway into impossibly labyrinthine tombs built by long-forgotten people.

Even the most ancient of these sites still echo with the memory and power of lives once lived, battles once fought, loves gained or lost, and vows unfulfilled.
