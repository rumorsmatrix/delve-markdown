## Fortified Stronghold
**Foes defend this place against intruders.** A fortified site is held and defended by an enemy force. It might be an enemy camp, an outpost, a fortress, or a closely-guarded territory.

Infiltrating this place requires caution and cunning. You may be forced to avoid inhabitants, sentries, and patrols. Revealing yourself or causing a disturbance will catch the attention of the denizens, perhaps forcing you to fight your way to your objective.

**A fortress secured against trespassers.** These sites weather storms and sieges alike. Their walls stand firm against the forces of this dark land. They are fortified against attack and rife with guards, traps, and other defenses. For those who dwell within, strongholds provide the comfort of wood and stone, axe and bow. For those who seek to breach the walls, they can be as unyielding and unforgiving as the most stalwart ironbound shield.
