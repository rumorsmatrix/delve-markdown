## Corrupted Pass
**This place is tainted by dark magic.** A corrupted site is befouled by dark forces. It might be the ancient magic of the Ironlands, or the residue of ancient evils, concentrated here like poisoned water soaked into a sponge. Perhaps a powerful mystic dwells in this place, one who walks a sinister path in search of power.

When you enter a corrupted site, you can feel the wrongness of it down to your bones. The air is tainted with foul smells, or tinged with strange energies. You hear unintelligible whispers. Shadows lurk at the edge of your vision. The creatures of this place are twisted by corruption, and the people are in thrall to a dark influence.

**Treacherous paths over high mountains.** Winding through highlands and mountain ranges, these sites offer a tempting route over otherwise impassable terrain. But treacherous landscapes, foul weather, and a host of mountain predators offer their own dangers. Raiders and others take advantage of these natural chokepoints to ambush the unwary.

Lonely cairns mark the resting places of those who walked these routes undefended or unprepared. Pray that your path here does not end under a pile of mountain stones.
