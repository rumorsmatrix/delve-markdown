## Wild Cavern
**Nature prevails in this place.** Despite our attempts to extend our control into untracked reaches, the primal forces of nature still hold sway across the Ironlands. In those wild places, we must test our shields against tooth and claw, our wits against insidious creatures, and our resolve against dangerous terrain and harsh environments.

Be wary when you enter the wild places of this world. Beyond the comforting walls of your village, you are not the hunter. You are the prey.

**A place of stone and darkness.** Another world lies beneath our feet. Caverns vein the Ironlands with meandering tunnels, plunging pits, soaring chambers, and absolute darkness. Claustrophobic crawlspaces and crevices may lead to miles-long cave complexes. Underground waterways carve a relentless path through stone.

When you enter these sites, you are a trespasser in a hostile domain. What unseen things dwell here, watching and waiting, amidst the depths?
