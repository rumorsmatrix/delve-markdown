## Infested Ruin
**Foul creatures dwell here.** Foul creatures swarm these sites, overwhelming trespassers with sheer numbers and unchecked ferocity. The denizens do little beyond multiplying, feeding, and expanding, ravenous for fresh kills to feed the swarm.

Navigation through this place, across paths undermined by the hordes, may be perilous. The sights and smells may test your fortitude. But it is the creatures which pose the greatest threat, as they ambush and cut off your escape with unforeseen cunning.

**The crumbling legacy of a dead civilization.** These decaying edifices, skeletal and shadowed, mark the remains of once-great communities and civilizations. Some of these sites have been newly adapted by Ironlanders as shelter, temple, or citadel. Others are home only to dangerous creatures and dark forces.

Newly discovered ruins tempt bold explorers with the promise of powerful legacies and forgotten secrets. But most see these places as a portent of our inescapable, grim fate in these lands. Someday, another people may delve into the ruins of what we leave behind.
