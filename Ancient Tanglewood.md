## Ancient Tanglewood
**This place holds the secrets of a bygone age.** An ancient site contains the mysteries, legacies, and dangers of another age.

Walking the paths of this place is like stepping through time. Ruins and relics provide glimpses of long-forgotten people and events. The knowledge and power hidden here are a tempting lure, but those treasures may come with a dire cost. Some secrets are best left buried.

**A perilous forest of eternal shadow.** A tanglewood is a thick wilderness, shrouded in mist. Overhanging, twisted boughs obscure the sky. The ground is snarled with exposed roots. The wind carries foreboding whispers, and branches rattle like old bones.

Many refuse to harvest wood from these places, believing the spirits who reside within will bring a curse upon them and their families. Others fear the creatures and beings which lurk within. For these reasons, even near settled areas, the tangles still stand.
