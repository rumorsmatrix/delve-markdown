## Wild Barrow
**Nature prevails in this place.** Despite our attempts to extend our control into untracked reaches, the primal forces of nature still hold sway across the Ironlands. In those wild places, we must test our shields against tooth and claw, our wits against insidious creatures, and our resolve against dangerous terrain and harsh environments.

Be wary when you enter the wild places of this world. Beyond the comforting walls of your village, you are not the hunter. You are the prey.

**The dead are enshrined here.** In this cruel land, there is no shortage of dead to be put to rest. Some barrows are simple crypts for a family or steading. Others are more elaborate or extensive, plunging well into the depths of the earth. A few inconspicuous mounds, their rock and earth worn by time, mark an entryway into impossibly labyrinthine tombs built by long-forgotten people.

Even the most ancient of these sites still echo with the memory and power of lives once lived, battles once fought, loves gained or lost, and vows unfulfilled.
