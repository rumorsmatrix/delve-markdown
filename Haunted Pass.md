## Haunted Pass
**Restless spirits are bound to this place.** Within a haunted site, dread, sadness, and fear are palpable. Disturbing sounds and visions lure the unwary and terrorize the vulnerable. Gird your will when you enter this place, for you walk at the boundary of life and death.

Some lost souls, unaware they have passed, wander the site in search of answers. Others, stricken by eternal grief, seek to set right what caused their death or see their vows fulfilled. But all too often, the denizens of this place are undone by their deaths. They are rage and terror made incarnate, feeling nothing but hate for the living and a hunger for warmth which will never be sated.

**Treacherous paths over high mountains.** Winding through highlands and mountain ranges, these sites offer a tempting route over otherwise impassable terrain. But treacherous landscapes, foul weather, and a host of mountain predators offer their own dangers. Raiders and others take advantage of these natural chokepoints to ambush the unwary.

Lonely cairns mark the resting places of those who walked these routes undefended or unprepared. Pray that your path here does not end under a pile of mountain stones.
