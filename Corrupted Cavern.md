## Corrupted Cavern
**This place is tainted by dark magic.** A corrupted site is befouled by dark forces. It might be the ancient magic of the Ironlands, or the residue of ancient evils, concentrated here like poisoned water soaked into a sponge. Perhaps a powerful mystic dwells in this place, one who walks a sinister path in search of power.

When you enter a corrupted site, you can feel the wrongness of it down to your bones. The air is tainted with foul smells, or tinged with strange energies. You hear unintelligible whispers. Shadows lurk at the edge of your vision. The creatures of this place are twisted by corruption, and the people are in thrall to a dark influence.

**A place of stone and darkness.** Another world lies beneath our feet. Caverns vein the Ironlands with meandering tunnels, plunging pits, soaring chambers, and absolute darkness. Claustrophobic crawlspaces and crevices may lead to miles-long cave complexes. Underground waterways carve a relentless path through stone.

When you enter these sites, you are a trespasser in a hostile domain. What unseen things dwell here, watching and waiting, amidst the depths?
