## Fortified Icereach
**Foes defend this place against intruders.** A fortified site is held and defended by an enemy force. It might be an enemy camp, an outpost, a fortress, or a closely-guarded territory.

Infiltrating this place requires caution and cunning. You may be forced to avoid inhabitants, sentries, and patrols. Revealing yourself or causing a disturbance will catch the attention of the denizens, perhaps forcing you to fight your way to your objective.

**A frigid landscape formed of frozen seas.** An Icereach is an expanse of frozen sea, blue-white and sprawling in all directions. These sites are typically found in the northernmost waters. However, a few vast icereaches— kept perpetually frozen by forces we do not understand—clog the seas in southern regions.

Only the cruelest, most powerful creatures can survive here. The terrain is rugged and cut-through with unstable ice and frigid waterways. Food is scarce. Bitter winds blast the landscape. The remains of ships, locked within the ice, stand as monuments to those who braved these places and were forever lost.
