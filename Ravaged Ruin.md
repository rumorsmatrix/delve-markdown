## Ravaged Ruin
**Time, disaster, or strife have taken their toll.** Time, weather, war, or calamity have laid waste to a ravaged site. The terrain is precarious. Hazards lurk around every corner. You may face glimpses of a former greatness, but this place is a ruined shadow of what it once was.

Traversing a ravaged site requires care, cunning, and quick wits to react to sudden perils. The environment here is your greatest enemy. It is a force, as willful as any intelligent adversary, which will see your quest undone.

**The crumbling legacy of a dead civilization.** These decaying edifices, skeletal and shadowed, mark the remains of once-great communities and civilizations. Some of these sites have been newly adapted by Ironlanders as shelter, temple, or citadel. Others are home only to dangerous creatures and dark forces.

Newly discovered ruins tempt bold explorers with the promise of powerful legacies and forgotten secrets. But most see these places as a portent of our inescapable, grim fate in these lands. Someday, another people may delve into the ruins of what we leave behind.
