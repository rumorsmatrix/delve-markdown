## Infested Tanglewood
**Foul creatures dwell here.** Foul creatures swarm these sites, overwhelming trespassers with sheer numbers and unchecked ferocity. The denizens do little beyond multiplying, feeding, and expanding, ravenous for fresh kills to feed the swarm.

Navigation through this place, across paths undermined by the hordes, may be perilous. The sights and smells may test your fortitude. But it is the creatures which pose the greatest threat, as they ambush and cut off your escape with unforeseen cunning.

**A perilous forest of eternal shadow.** A tanglewood is a thick wilderness, shrouded in mist. Overhanging, twisted boughs obscure the sky. The ground is snarled with exposed roots. The wind carries foreboding whispers, and branches rattle like old bones.

Many refuse to harvest wood from these places, believing the spirits who reside within will bring a curse upon them and their families. Others fear the creatures and beings which lurk within. For these reasons, even near settled areas, the tangles still stand.
