## Ravaged Sea Cave
**Time, disaster, or strife have taken their toll.** Time, weather, war, or calamity have laid waste to a ravaged site. The terrain is precarious. Hazards lurk around every corner. You may face glimpses of a former greatness, but this place is a ruined shadow of what it once was.

Traversing a ravaged site requires care, cunning, and quick wits to react to sudden perils. The environment here is your greatest enemy. It is a force, as willful as any intelligent adversary, which will see your quest undone.

**Stone passages carved by ocean waves.** Carved by ocean waves and unyielding currents, the sea caves pockmarking the coasts plunge deep into the landâ€™s dark heart. Deadly creatures or determined foes often lair within, but it is the water that is your ever-present enemy. The chill and damp seep into your bones. The tides and upland flooding can bring a torrent of water with little warning. You plunge desperately through submerged passages, praying that an opening will provide a pocket of air.

This is a realm of water and stone, cold and darkness. You are not welcome here.
